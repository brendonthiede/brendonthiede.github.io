<p>Well, I'm just a guy trying to do the best I can for my daughter while trying to be the best I can at work. I may not be much, but I'm the best me I can be and always trying to be better.</p>
<p>I like to run, bike, play soccer, or play pretty much any kind of sport. I also like problem solving, which, as a software engineer, usually involves computers, either by programming or hacking together various services.</p>
<p>With my daughter, some of our favorite things to do together are go to Impression 5, play at one of the many parks in the greater Lansing area, head to Potter Park Zoo, or just chill on the couch reading a book. She also really enjoys getting pushed in her jogger while I'm running, even when it's for a couple hours.</p>
