                    Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

                <p>
                    Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

                    Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

                    Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

                <p>
                    Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job
                    done.

                    The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

                <p>
                    Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant
                    pace indefinitely.

                    Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

                    The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

                    At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

                <h2>Agile in Practice</h2>
                <p>JIS uses a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the
                    start of the project.

                <h2>Agile in Practice</h2>
                <p>
                    Projects are broken down into little bits of user functionality called user stories (aka cards).

                <h2>Agile in Practice</h2>
                <p>
                    Work is prioritized and then continuously delivered in short two week cycles called iterations (aka sprints).

                    Teams may customize their processes to optimize how they work, but certain ceremonies and events are required.
