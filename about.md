As my core identity, I am a Christian, and I am lucky to live very close to [Riverview Church](https://rivchurch.com).  On top of that I am a husband to my beautiful wife.  I also get to be a father to my daughter and my two sons.  My whole family enjoys running, which I have been doing since I was 7.  Professionally, I am a DevOps Engineer, where I get to work with diverse groups of people using diverse technologies to solve interesting problems.  I also help with organizing the Lansing DevOps Meetup, which helps me keep on top of new trends, tools, and techniques.
