I am a DevOps Engineer who gets the privilege to work with diverse groups of people using diverse technologies to solve interesting problems.  I also help with organizing the [Lansing DevOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-DevOps-Meetup/), which helps me keep on top of new trends, tools, and techniques. My interests include pretty much anything to do with automating the Software Delivery Lifecycle and optimizing the delivery of value.
