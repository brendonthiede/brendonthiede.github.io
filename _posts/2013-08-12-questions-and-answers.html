<p>When your daughter comes to you troubled by hard questions about life, how do you respond, especially when you don't even know the answers or if they even exist?  I just try to be honest and as direct as I feel is appropriate, but the hardest part is not allowing my emotions to get in the way.  I want her to know I have emotions but to also understand the difference between feelings and facts.</p>
