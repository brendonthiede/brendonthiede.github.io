<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lovelocal-5k-tickets-16507187442"><span class="s2">LoveLocal 5K</span></a> is in support of the <a href="http://rivchurch.com/ministries/outward-ministries/compassion"><span class="s2">Compassion Ministry</span></a> at Riverview Church. Race will be at Potter Park, going east on the Rivertrail, at 7:00pm on Friday, June 12th, 2015.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And here's my challenge... For every runner that places ahead of me I will donate $20 to the Compassion Ministry. If you want more details or want to persuade me with a different "side wager" you can add a comment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other details: chip timing by Chuck Block, age group awards, several gift cards will be awarded. The gift cards that I know of are $20 gift cards to various local places that will be awarded to age group winners as well as $100 gift certificates to Capital Prime for one male and one female (not sure if it's a drawing or for overall winners).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hope to see you there! </span></p>
