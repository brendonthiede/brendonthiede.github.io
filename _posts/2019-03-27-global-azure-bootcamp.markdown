I am very excited to announce that there will be a Global Azure Bootcamp location in Lansing this year on Saturday, April 27th, 2019, from 9:00am to 5:00pm. This is a free event (lunch included!) that will give people of all levels the opportunity to learn about Microsoft Azure and get hands-on experience using credits provided by Microsoft. The format of the bootcamps varies by location, but the format for Lansing is going to be highly focused on beginners. It will be a mixture of prepared content and workshops. As a group, we'll go from have a very simple website that anyone could use as a personal website/blog, but then we'll iteratively look at what it takes to scale it up and what the new considerations are as we progress, eventually with a web app that is leveraging Azure Functions and Cosmos DB along with some of the other leading edge technologies available in Azure. Each step of the way you'll be able to have something that you can walk away and use _right now_!

The venue for the bootcamp is ["The Fledge"](http://thefledge.com/), which is a really cool work/collaboration space for entrepreneurs and explorers. If you're in the Lansing area and haven't checked it out, you really should!

Did I mention this event is free?!?! _AND_ you get some Azure credits to use for up to a month after the bootcamp. To register, go to [https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-DevOps-Meetup/events/260049834/](https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-DevOps-Meetup/events/260049834/).
