After taking a long time off from trying this whole online presence thing, I'm going to give it another shot.  One of the things that discouraged me previously was the way that I interacted with WordPress.  So should I try to figure out how to get better at using WordPress?  Should I search for newer better plugins that always stay up to date and never cause problems?  That sounds hard.  It sounds a lot easier to switch to a different platform.  Jekyll sounds good...

I installed [Ruby 2.4.3](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/download/rubyinstaller-2.4.3-2/rubyinstaller-2.4.3-2-x64.exe) with the dev toolkit.  The first time I ran the installer, I only ran the MYSYS2 base installation, so I had to run `ridk install` again, telling it this time to install "MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain" (option 3).  Prior to doing this I was getting an error about `make` not being a recognized command when trying to install the jekyll gem.

Then I started ripping off commands in PowerShell:

{% highlight powershell %}
gem install jekyll bundler
{% endhighlight %}

With the base Jekyll installation ready, I wanted to try it out, so I created a new site:

{% highlight powershell %}
Set-Location $env:USERPROFILE\Source\Repos
jekyll new whatbrendonthinks.com
Set-Location .\whatbrendonthinks.com
bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

And there was much rejoicing.

Now I had all the needed tools at the ready.  Next I needed to connect into my WordPress site and do an export of "All content", which I saved as `$env:USERPROFILE\Source\Repos\whatbrendonthinks.com\wordpress-export.xml`

Next I installed a couple items to use for importing my WordPress posts/pages and did the actual import:

{% highlight powershell %}
Set-Location $env:USERPROFILE\Source\Repos\whatbrendonthinks.com
gem install jekyll-import open_uri_redirections
ruby -rubygems -e "require 'jekyll-import'; JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({ 'source' => 'wordpress-export.xml' })"
bundle exec jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

I'm not sure what would have happened if I had started with an import versus doing the `jekyll new` first, but the way that I did it I ended up with some of the example data mixed in with my data, though it was segregated enough to easily pull out or modify to fit my needs.
